- For consitency prefer fetching data using SQL-like querying over conventional (not SQL-like) relational query methods (e.g., db.query.[table].findMany({ with: { ... } }))
- Use db.$count() operator when getting totals
- Where possible use aggregation helper functions such as count/countDistinct/avg/avgDistinct/sum/sumDistinct/max/min over custom sql`` template for common cases
